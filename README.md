Jasmine Boilerplate 
===================

To the existing framework, I have added Tests to validate Retirement calculator app on Securion web page.
Additional Notes on my changes:
1. Tests are written under the file name: 'test/specs/retirementCalculator.spec.ts'
2. Followed PageObject pattern approach and the page objects files that I created are - 'test/pageObjects/retirementCalcDfltVals.page.ts' & 'test/pageObjects/retirementCalcReqVals.page.ts'
3. I have written the code in TypeScript and used the Jasmine framework.
4. Tests read the input data from a Json file. Test data file - 'test/resources/testData/RetirementData1.json'
5. Added Allure Reporting to the framework.
6. Test can be triggered from the terminal using command - 'npm run test:local' .
